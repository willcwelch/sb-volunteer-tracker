# Community Engagement Database

A web app for the Stony Brook University community to track volunteer data for projects of all sizes and increase awareness of service work.

## Overview

Stony Brook University currently has no central way to track volunteer hours performed by university departments. This information is important because it is collected by the State University of New York and shows how the university is serving its community.

An existing solution, SB Life, is geared towards student clubs and doesn’t support the degree of tracking the university requires. Organizations that use it do so because they are required to by the Student Activities office. Most don’t use its events feature. Another solution, Google forms, doesn’t allow users to see their own input, and most campus departments have not invested the time to collect or input their data.

The proposed application will support Stony Brook volunteer projects of all sizes, including those on the main campus, Stony Brook Medicine, the Research and Development Park and Southampton campus. It will move tracking from the department level to the organization and project level, providing an intuitive interface for users to track their own data and aggregate it for use by the university.


## Problem Statement

**The problem of** not being able to track volunteer data

**affects** the Stony Brook University Community Relations office,

**the impact of which is** it cannot show stakeholders how the university is serving its community.

**A successful solution would** be an application that allows volunteer projects and organizations to track their own data, aggregating that data for use by the university.

## Product Position Statement

**For** Stony Brook University volunteer projects and organizations

**who** are doing volunteer work and need a way to track and promote their impact,

**our system** is a responsive website

**that** allows organizers to log in and record service work, view reports and share data with the university.

**Unlike** SB Life and Google Forms,

**our product** will allow users to see and use their data, which will give them a reason to track their service work.

## Users

Our users are members of the university community—students, faculty and staff—who lead service projects and organizations. They lead initiatives of all kinds and sizes, from fundraising to community outreach and education. They want an easy way to track all of the work they do so they can understand their impact and share it with the community at large. Some of our users are students who have grown up with the internet and can easily understand how to use a web application. Others are professors who have experience using tools like Blackboard, but need clear direction and feedback when filling out web forms or navigating pages. Staff users have experience with administrative tools, but need a service that is fast, intuitive and doesn’t add a burden to their existing workload.

## Feature List

- Members of the university can log in using a NetID and password.
- Account profiles include a title, contact information and organization memberships.
- Organizations have a university affiliation, members and projects.
- Projects have a type and events, which are the base unit of service work.
- Events include a time, location, number of volunteers, a description of impact and photos. They can either be literal events or the aggregate of several events.
- Users can create or join organizations.
- Members of an organization can create or edit projects.
- Members can add or edit events in a project.
- Impact reports can be viewed by project, organization or university affiliation.

## Constraints

The solution must be compatible with Stony Brook University’s servers. This means the website will likely rely on a PHP/MySQL backend. It must be maintainable, well-documented and stable.
